# Welcome to TigerSnatch!

[TigerSnatch](https://tigersnatch.com) helps Princeton students with course enrollment through its Subscriptions and Trades features. With Subscriptions, students can receive an email and text message when spots open in a full course, so they can avoid repeatedly checking official Course Offerings. TigerSnatch Trades, a first-of-its-kind system at Princeton, connects students who want to switch into each other's full sections.

> TigerSnatch began as a Spring '21 COS333 project at Princeton University by Shannon Heh '23, Nicholas Padmanabhan '23, and Byron Zhang '23.

        If you're already enrolled in a full section but wish to switch into another, use Trades.
        From the dropdown, select and save your currently enrolled section. Then, click Find
        Trades to view and contact other Tigers who are enrolled in a section you want (i.e. one
        of your Subscriptions) and who are subscribed to your currently enrolled section.

        It's that simple! The next time a spot opens up in a subscribed section, you'll be
        notified immediately via email and text message. If you didn't get the spot, just
        resubscribe on TigerSnatch to get notified when spots open again. To unsubscribe from a
        section, simply toggle the section's switch off in the Dashboard. Or, if you want to stay
        subscribed until you manually unsubscribe, change your settings on the Dashboard!
